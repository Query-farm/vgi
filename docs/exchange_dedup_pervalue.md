# Input Dedup + Per-Value Memoization for Exchange-Mode Maps — Design

Status: **APPROVED — implementing** (phased; see §8). Author: cache maintainers.
Unifies the per-input caching story across the **map-shaped** exchange operators (scalar,
streaming table-in-out, batched correlated LATERAL) and reframes the existing per-batch/per-chunk
result caches (M1/M2) as a coarse outer layer over a finer **per-value** one. Buffered (M3, a
*reduce*) is unaffected.

## 1. Motivation

The exchange-mode result cache (M1 streaming, M2 LATERAL, M3 buffered) keys on the **whole input
unit** — a batch (M1), a chunk (M2), or the entire input multiset (M3). For the *reduce* shape
(buffered) whole-input keying is correct. For the *map* shapes it is the **wrong granularity** for
the workload people actually run:

> an expensive remote **map** over a **low-cardinality** input — `enrich(country_code)`,
> `label(enum)`, `embed(text)` — called for millions of rows but with only a few hundred distinct
> inputs.

Per-batch/per-chunk memoization only hits when an *identical batch* recurs; it captures ~none of the
massive per-**value** reuse. Two independent wins are available and they compose:

1. **Input dedup (compute, no persistence).** Ship only the *distinct* input tuples in a chunk to
   the worker; scatter the results back. Turns 2048 worker evals into ~200 for a low-cardinality
   column, zero cache, zero durability risk. DuckDB does **not** do this for a volatile remote
   function, so it is on us. Helps *every* query.
2. **Per-value memo (durability).** Cache the worker output keyed on the *individual input tuple*.
   Extends dedup's reuse across chunks, queries, and restarts — where an expensive map (embeddings,
   enrichment APIs) really pays. Helps the *expensive* maps.

**Per-value dominates per-batch.** On the low-cardinality workload per-value nails it and per-batch
misses; on an identical-chunk replay per-value gives 100% hits too (every value was stored on the
first run) — the same end result per-batch would give, just keyed finer. Per-batch's *only* edge is
one lookup vs K, in the narrow "identical high-cardinality chunk recurs verbatim" case. So per-value
is the primary mechanism; per-batch is demoted to a coarse fallback (§6).

## 2. Scope — which operators

| Operator | Shape | Today | This design |
|---|---|---|---|
| **scalar** (`vgi_scalar_function_impl.cpp`) | 1:1 map, positional | **no cache** | dedup + per-value |
| **streaming table-in-out** (`VgiTableInOutFunction`, no-finalize) | 1:N map per row | M1 per-batch | dedup + per-value (per-batch kept as coarse layer) |
| **batched LATERAL** (`PhysicalVgiLateralBatch`) | 1:N map per row + correlated stamp | M2 per-chunk | dedup + per-value (per-chunk kept as coarse layer) |
| **buffered** (`PhysicalVgiTableBufferingFunction`) | **reduce** over whole input | M3 whole-input | **unchanged** — whole-input keying is right for a reduce |

Eligibility is the existing per-row-purity gate: streaming/LATERAL already require
`input_from_args && !has_finalize` (no cross-row worker state); the scalar's `vgi.cache.*` opt-in
carries the same promise. **Dedup and per-value require exactly this purity** — the output of row `i`
depends only on row `i`'s input tuple + the static bind dimensions. A worker that violates it (RNG,
wall-clock, cross-row accumulator) must not advertise cacheability and must not be dedup-eligible.

## 3. Input dedup — the shared front-end

A pure compute transform at each operator's exchange boundary, independent of any cache.

**Shared helper `vgi_input_dedup.{hpp,cpp}`** — `BuildInputDedup(chunk, worker_col_ids) → InputDedup`:
- Canonical per-row NULL-aware key over the **worker-input columns only** (the args passed to the
  function — NOT the correlated/outer columns) via `CreateSortKeyHelpers::CreateSortKey`, hashed into
  a group id. Reuses the same machinery as `HashInputChunkUnordered`.
- Produces:
  - `distinct` — a `SelectionVector` picking one representative original row per distinct tuple
    (length `K`), used to build the K-row deduped input to ship.
  - `orig_to_distinct[n]` — for each of the N original rows, the index `d ∈ [0,K)` of its tuple.
  - `groups[d]` — the list of original row indices sharing distinct tuple `d` (the inverse map).
- `K == N` (all-distinct) is the no-op fast path — return a trivial identity and skip dedup so
  high-cardinality data pays only the hash, not a pointless regroup.

### 3.1 Scatter mechanics — per shape

**Scalar (1:1).** Ship the K deduped rows; the worker returns K outputs (1:1). Scatter is a single
gather: `result[n] = worker_out[orig_to_distinct[n]]` via a `SelectionVector` → one
`VectorOperations::Copy`. Trivial.

**LATERAL (1:N + stamp) — the crux.** The worker is 1:N per input row and the operator must stamp the
**correlated/outer columns** onto every output row (`StampProjected`,
`vgi_lateral_batch_operator.cpp`). With dedup this becomes a **two-level** scatter, and the subtlety
is: **dedup keys on the worker-input tuple, but two original rows can share that tuple while differing
in *other* outer columns** (same `country_code`, different `order_id`). So the worker output for a
distinct tuple must be replicated to *every* original row in its group, and each copy stamped with
**that original row's own** outer columns — not the representative's.

Concretely, the worker returns output rows carrying `vgi_rpc.parent_row = d` (an index into the
**deduped** input). The operator composes:

```
worker_output_row w  (parent = d, a DEDUPED index)
   → groups[d] = { original rows o0, o1, … }        // inverse map from dedup
   → for each o in groups[d]: emit one output row
        [ worker columns copied from w | outer columns gathered from ORIGINAL row o ]
```

Output cardinality = Σ_w |groups[parent(w)]| (fan-out × group size), drained across
`HAVE_MORE_OUTPUT`. `PhysicalVgiLateralBatch` is `NO_ORDER`, so emitting the expansion in any order is
sound — the same property that already makes per-chunk replay sound. The existing `StampProjected`
gathers outer columns at a parent index; the new version gathers at the *original* row `o` while
copying worker columns at `w` — a selection-vector pair instead of one.

**Streaming table-in-out (1:N, no stamp).** Same as LATERAL minus the correlated stamp: replicate a
distinct tuple's worker output to each original row in its group (positional identity — no outer
columns to re-associate). Simpler than LATERAL, same inverse-map expansion.

## 4. Per-value memoization — the durability layer

Sits *between* dedup and the worker. After dedup yields `K` distinct tuples, look them up in the
cache; only the **misses** go to the worker; store the fresh results.

- **Key.** The existing `VgiResultCacheKey` with `input_hash` = the **per-tuple** hash (single row's
  canonical sort-key blob), plus a **granularity discriminator** so a per-value entry can never
  collide with a per-batch entry in the same keyspace (prefix: `"v\x1f" + tuple_hash` for per-value,
  the whole-unit hash stays per-batch). Static dims unchanged: identity scope (auth principal —
  security boundary), worker, function, **const params**, settings, versions, `catalog_version`
  (DDL/`vgi_clear_cache()` invalidation all reused).
- **Value.** The worker's output for **one input tuple** — for scalar a single value, for
  streaming/LATERAL the 0..M output rows that tuple produced (its `parent_row` slice, pre-stamp for
  LATERAL so the stamp is applied per original row on serve). A tiny variable-size batch → the
  **packed disk tier** is the ideal home (this is precisely the many-tiny-entries case it was built
  for). Memory tier + packed disk + stats + identity scope + invalidation all reused verbatim.
- **Batched lookup.** `K` per-row lookups per chunk would be a mutex storm on the singleton, so add
  `VgiResultCache::LookupBatch(keys) → vector<entry>` taking the lock **once** per chunk. Symmetric
  `InsertBatch` for the misses.
- **Serve/store flow per chunk:** dedup → `LookupBatch(K keys)` → partition into {hits, misses} →
  ship only misses to the worker → assemble the K distinct outputs (cached ⊕ fresh) →
  `InsertBatch(fresh)` → scatter/expand to N via §3.1.

## 5. Correctness invariants

- **Per-row purity is the contract** (§2). The framework can't detect a violation generically — it is
  the worker author's responsibility, same as the M1 stateful-map guardrail. Advertising `vgi.cache.*`
  (or, for dedup-without-cache, being an `input_from_args && !has_finalize` map) is the promise.
- **Null-safe canonical tuple key** (`CreateSortKey`), multi-arg maps keyed on the whole **tuple**.
- **The LATERAL stamp must use the original row's outer columns** (§3.1) — the one thing that would
  silently corrupt if done naively (stamping the representative's outer columns). Regression test with
  a fixture where rows share the worker-input arg but differ in an outer column.
- **DuckDB scalar stability.** A VGI scalar's registered volatility interacts with constant folding;
  dedup/memo must not change observable results for a *pure* function (the only kind eligible).
- **Identity scope** stays folded into every per-value key — two auth principals never share a
  per-value entry, exactly as for the whole-unit entries.

## 6. Coexistence with M1 / M2 / M3

A clean **layering**, outer (coarse) to inner (fine):

```
[ per-batch/per-chunk memo (M1/M2) ]   ← whole-unit hit: replay whole output, skip everything
        ↓ miss
[ input dedup ]                        ← compute: distinct tuples only
        ↓
[ per-value memo ]                     ← per-tuple hit: skip worker for that tuple
        ↓ misses
[ worker exchange ]
```

- **A per-batch/per-chunk hit** (M1/M2, unchanged) short-circuits the whole pipeline — one lookup,
  whole cached output. Fastest path for a verbatim-chunk replay.
- **On a per-batch miss**, dedup + per-value minimize worker calls and populate the per-value tier.
- **M3 buffered is untouched** — a reduce's output depends on the whole input multiset, so
  whole-input keying is correct and there is no per-value analog.
- **Storage-amplification guard.** Storing *both* a whole-batch entry and K per-value entries for the
  same data is redundant for low-cardinality inputs (per-value already covers a future identical-chunk
  replay). So the **per-batch store is gated on the distinct ratio**: only write the coarse whole-unit
  entry when `K/N` is high (per-value would give a poor hit rate on a future replay). This is a
  *store*-side gate on a per-chunk cardinality signal — **not** a miss-history back-off, so it does
  **not** reproduce the store-then-hit hazard that got the adaptive-hashing back-off declined
  (per-value still always stores its misses; only the redundant coarse copy is skipped). Reads always
  probe both tiers.

The `input_hash` granularity discriminator (§4) keeps the two entry kinds in one keyspace without
collision, so `vgi_result_cache()` / stats / flush / disk tier all treat them uniformly.

## 7. Settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|--:|---|
| `vgi_exchange_input_dedup` | `true` | Dedup distinct worker-input tuples in a chunk before the exchange (compute win; scalar + streaming + LATERAL). No persistence, no correctness risk beyond the per-row-purity opt-in. |
| `vgi_result_cache_per_value` | `true` | Per-value memoization layer (durability). Gated by the master `vgi_result_cache` + per-catalog `cache` opt-out like every other cache tier. |
| `vgi_exchange_per_batch_min_distinct_ratio` | `0.5` | Store the coarse whole-unit (M1/M2) entry only when `K/N ≥` this (else per-value covers replay). 0 = always store the coarse entry (today's behavior); 1 = never. |

Dedup is a compute optimization and defaults ON independently of the disk tier; per-value persistence
rides the existing disk-tier opt-in (needs a cache dir to reach disk, memory-only otherwise).

## 8. Phasing

1. **Scalar dedup** — the shared `BuildInputDedup` helper + the 1:1 scatter in
   `VgiScalarFunctionExecute`. Self-contained, simplest scatter, immediate win, and scalars have **no
   cache today** so nothing to coexist with. Fixture: an expensive/observable scalar over a
   low-cardinality column; assert `scalar.write_input` row count drops to the distinct count.
2. **LATERAL + streaming dedup** — the 1:N inverse-map expansion in `PhysicalVgiLateralBatch` (the
   stamp-per-original-row crux) and the streaming table-in-out map. Regression: shared-arg /
   different-outer-column fixture; result-equivalence vs `SET vgi_exchange_input_dedup=false`.
3. **Per-value memo (all three)** — `LookupBatch`/`InsertBatch`, the per-tuple key + granularity
   discriminator, the dedup→lookup→partition→ship-misses→assemble→store→scatter flow. Both transports.
4. **Coexistence + gate** — the M1/M2 layering + the distinct-ratio store gate; stats
   (`exchange_*` sub-counters already exist) to make hit rate observable; decide defaults from data.

Ship 1 first (no storage, big win, low risk), measure, then layer.

## 10. Open questions

- **Per-value entry churn.** Millions of distinct values (a genuinely high-cardinality *and*
  cross-query-repeating column — e.g. user ids) could mint millions of per-value entries. The packed
  store + byte/entry caps bound it, but is a per-value cache the right tool there, or should
  high-cardinality lean on dedup-only? The distinct-ratio gate (§6) covers the coarse copy; a parallel
  guard may be wanted for per-value *stores* — but must respect the store-then-hit lesson (don't gate
  on miss history). Lean: cap per-chunk *new* stores, not ratio-gate them.
- **Streaming vs LATERAL de-dup overlap.** A correlated blended call decorrelates to LATERAL; the
  classic TABLE-input streaming map is the only pure-M1 path. Confirm the streaming dedup is worth the
  code vs scoping phase 2 to LATERAL only (the common correlated case).
